# Create-phone-numbers-for-tests
This script will help you generate all possible phone numbers (or just numbers) for testing your applications, given the number of unknown numbers (X or x)

For example: 
1. If there is only X in the number, then there are 10 possible options (from 0 to 9)
2. If XX => 100 possible options (from 00 to 99)
3. And so on

P.S. It does not matter where the X's are located, whether they will be consecutive or separate in the number you specify
