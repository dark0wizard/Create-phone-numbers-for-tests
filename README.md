# Create-phone-numbers-for-tests
This script will help you generate all possible phone numbers (or just numbers) for testing your applications, given the number of unknown numbers (X or x)

For example: 
1. If there is only X in the number, then there are 10 possible options (from 0 to 9)
2. If XX => 100 possible options (from 00 to 99)
3. And so on
